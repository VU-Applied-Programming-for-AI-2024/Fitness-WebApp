## Brief description of the project
myFitnessAI Coach is an AI-powered platform designed to create personalized fitness schedules based on users' available time, equipment, and desired difficulty level. We will use an API while accessing user information stored in a MongoDB database, the platform delivers tailored workout plans to help users achieve their fitness goals. The application leverages Azure for deployment, ensuring scalability and reliability. We implemented a CI/CD workflow pipeline for a continuous real-time deployment. App's key features will include an intuitive search interface for discovering exercises, dynamic exercise scheduling, and seamless user data managemen, along with data visualization regarding exercise details.
